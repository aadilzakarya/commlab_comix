Project Name
Comic – Party Preparation! 

Project Description
Our group created a comic about a girl preparing for a party in a hurry. She gets a text message reminding her of the party that she completely forgot about. As she prepares for the party, the viewer gets to support her through various steps.

Process
Aadil and Abdullah focused on the coding component of the project, while Daeun and Aya mainly worked on the illustrations. We embedded a variety of interactive functions such as opening a message, choosing a dress, and interacting with the cat – with some sound effects and music. By doing so, we turned a simple plot into a more interesting and engaging comic. 

Reflection/Evaluation
Inserting multiple images in a panel and coding the interactivity was the most challenging part. 
Adding the option to change the dress colour was particularly tricky. We had to use the IDs created in the svg to hide/show one of the dresses when the button was clicked. Our comic, however, lacked well defined panels, which could have been included in the svg file itself.
